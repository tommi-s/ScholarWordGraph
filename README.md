# Preparations

1. Open a Google Scholar profile with browser (e.g., https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SGgP0VQAAAAJ ).
1. Go to the bottom of the page and click "SHOW MORE" to show all entries on the page.
1. Go again to the bottom of the newly-expanded page.
1. Select everything in the table, starting from the year of the last entry (on the bottom-right corner) and ending at the title of the first entry (on the top-left corner).
1. Copy the selected text.
1. Paste the text to a text editor and save as "data/publications.txt".

# Load the Data


```r
data.loaded <- 
  readr::read_delim(
    file = "data/publications.txt",
    delim = "\t",
    escape_double = FALSE,
    col_names = FALSE,
    trim_ws = TRUE
  )
```

```
## Rows: 96 Columns: 1
```

```
## -- Column specification --------------------------------------------------------
## Delimiter: "\t"
## chr (1): X1
```

```
## 
## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

# Format the Data

## Create a Data Frame of Articles

* Create a matrix with articles as rows and title, authors and journal as the three columns.
* Convert to a data frame.


```r
data <- unlist( data.loaded )
```

```
## Warning: One or more parsing issues, see `problems()` for details
```

```r
data <-
  matrix(
    data = unlist( data ),
    ncol = 3,
    byrow = TRUE
  )

colnames( data ) <-
  c(
    "Title",
    "Authors",
    "Journal"
  )

data <-
  data.frame(
    data,
    stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )
```

## Convert Titles to Lower Case

* To match identical words with different case, convert all to lowercase.


```r
data$"Title.lower" <-
  tolower( data$"Title" )
```

## Define Multi-Word Terms

* Define word sequences that should be considered as a single term by adding replacing whitespace with underscore.
* E.g., "type 1 diabetes" is one term.


```r
data$"Title.lower" <-
  stringr::str_replace_all(
    string = data$"Title.lower",
    # pattern = "type 1 diabete",
    pattern = "type 1 diabetes",
    replacement = "type_1_diabetes"
  )

data$"Title.lower" <-
  stringr::str_replace_all(
    string = data$"Title.lower",
    pattern = "type 2 diabetes",
    replacement = "type_2_diabetes"
  )
```

## Omit Special Characters

* Omit punctuation and special characters from the titles.


```r
words <-
  stringr::str_split(
    string = data[ , "Title.lower" ],
    pattern = "\\s"
  )

words <- 
  lapply(
    X = words,
    FUN = tolower
  )

words <-
  lapply(
    X = words,
    FUN = stringr::str_replace_all,
    pattern = "(\\()|(\\))|(\\:)|(\\,)|(\\.)",
    replacement = ""
  )

table.words <- 
  sort(
    x = table( unlist( words ) ),
    decreasing = TRUE
  )
```

## Extract Unique Words

* List all unique words that appear in the titles.


```r
words.unique <-
  sort(
    unique(
      unlist( words ) )
  )
```

## Define List of Blocked Words

* List general words that are not of interest.
* Add plain numbers to this list.


```r
blocklist <-
  c(
    "in",
    "of",
    "and",
    "the",
    "with",
    "for",
    "from",
    "to",
    "...",
    "an",
    "at",
    "on",
    letters,
    "after",
    "are",
    "as",
    "based",
    "by",
    "do",
    "is",
    "not",
    "without",
    "through",
    "during"
  )

blocklist <- 
  c(
    blocklist,
    words.unique[ grepl( x = words.unique, pattern = "^[0-9]+$" ) ]
  )
```

## Omit Blocked Words

* Omit the blocked words from the words list of each article.


```r
words <-
  lapply(
    X = words,
    FUN = function( x ) {
      x[ !( x %in% blocklist ) ]
    }
  )
```

# Re-Extract Unique Words


```r
words.unique <-
  sort(
    unique(
      unlist( words ) )
  )
```

# Create the Words-by-Articles Occurrence Matrix

* Matrix that has value 1 if the word (row) appears in the article (column) and 0 otherwise.


```r
wba <-
  array(
    data = 0,
    dim = c( length( words.unique ), nrow( data ) )
  )

rownames( wba ) <- words.unique
colnames( wba ) <- data[ , "Title" ]

for ( i in 1:nrow( data ) ) {
  
  wba[ words[[ i ]], i ] <- 1
  
}
```

## Log-Transform the Occurrences

* Trasform the occurrences with log (1+x) for a more Gaussian-like distribution.


```r
wba.log1px <- log10( 1 + wba )
```

## Autoscale the Occurrence Profiles

* Scale the data for PCA.


```r
wba.norm <- scale( wba.log1px )
```

# Principal Component Analysis

## Compute PCA


```r
result.pca <-
  princomp(
    x = wba.norm
  )
```

## Plot PCA


```r
library( "ggfortify" )
```

```
## Warning: package 'ggfortify' was built under R version 4.0.5
```

```
## Loading required package: ggplot2
```

```
## Warning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.0.5
```

```r
plot <-
  autoplot( 
    result.pca
    # ,
    # loadings = TRUE,
    # loadings.label = TRUE
  )

print( plot )
```

![](README_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.jpeg)<!-- -->

# Cluster the Words

* Using a fixed number of eight clusters for a suitable visual representation.


```r
result.clustering <-
  cluster::pam(
    x = wba.norm,
    k = 8
  )
```

# Figure

## Prepare Results for the Visualization

* Extract PCA-scores of the two first components.
* Extract cluster assignments for each data point.
* Compute each data point's Euclidean distance from the origin.
* Wrap multi-word terms to multiple lines for better visual impression.
* Create a text string listing all the article titles, where the term appears.


```r
data.plot <-
  data.frame(
    Word = rownames( result.pca$"scores" ),
    result.pca$"scores"
  )

data.plot$"Cluster" <- 
  factor(
    x = result.clustering$"clustering",
    levels = 1:length( unique( result.clustering$"clustering" ) ),
    labels = 
      c(
        "Cluster (C) 1",
        paste( "C", 2:length( unique( result.clustering$"clustering" ) ) )
      )
  )
  
data.plot$"Distance" <- 
  sqrt( data.plot$"Comp.1"^2 + data.plot$"Comp.2"^2 ) + 1

data.plot$"Term" <-
  stringr::str_replace_all(
    string = data.plot$"Word",
    pattern = "\\-",
    replacement = "-\n"
  )

data.plot$"Term" <-
  stringr::str_replace_all(
    string = data.plot$"Word",
    pattern = "\\_",
    replacement = "\n"
  )

data.plot$"Publications" <-
  apply(
    X = wba[ data.plot$"Word", ] == 1,
    MAR = 1,
    FUN = function( x ) {
      paste(
        "\n",
        names(
          which( x )
        ),
        collapse = "\n"
      )
    }
  )
```

## Define the Figure

* Visualization with ggplot2.
* PCA components 1 and 2, respectively, on the y- and x-axes.
* Term name as text label.
* Distance from origin as (increasing) size.
* Cluster assignment as color.
* Add jitter to reduce overlap of similar terms.
* Use pseudo-log-valued axes for reduced outliers.
* 


```r
jitter <- 1

palette <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal( n = 9, "Set1" )[ -6 ]
palette <- palette[ 1:nlevels( data.plot$"Cluster" ) ]

plot <-
  ggplot2::ggplot(
    data = data.plot,
    mapping =
      ggplot2::aes(
        x = Comp.2,
        y = Comp.1,
        label = Term,
        size = Distance,
        text = Publications
        ,
        color = Cluster,
      )
  ) +
  ggplot2::geom_text(
    position =
      ggplot2::position_jitter(
        height = jitter,
        width = jitter
      )
  ) +
  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous( trans = "pseudo_log" ) +
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous( trans = "pseudo_log" ) +
  ggplot2::theme(
    axis.text.y = ggplot2::element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = ggplot2::element_blank()
  ) +
  ggplot2::xlab( label = "\n\n\nMap of my research topics" ) +
  ggplot2::ylab( label = "" ) +
  ggplot2::scale_color_manual( values = palette )
```

## Create the Interactive Figure

* Make ggplot2 figure interactive with the *ggplotly*-function from the *plotly*-package.
* Show the term and the articles, where it appears, as text (tooltip) when hovering over a data point.
* Use the layout-function for fine-tuning of the legend.


```r
library( tidyr )

plot.interactive <-
  plotly::ggplotly( 
    p = plot,
    tooltip = c( "label", "Publications" )
  ) %>%
  plotly::layout(
    legend = 
      list(
        orientation = "h",
        title = list( text = "Cluster<br>" ),
        x = quantile( x = data.plot$"Comp.2", probs = 0.67 ),
        y = min( data.plot$"Comp.1" )
      )
  )
```

## View the Interactive Figure
